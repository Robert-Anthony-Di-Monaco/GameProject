	All code except where indicated was written by Robert Anthony Di Monaco.

	Assets were taken from the Unity Asset Store --> all were offered for free.
	
	Characters + Animations were taken from Mixamo --> all were offered for free.
	
	My intention for this project is to develop my skill in game development, to try new techniques and to have a platform to showcase my level of skill.
	
	I currently do not intend to sell this game for profit.
